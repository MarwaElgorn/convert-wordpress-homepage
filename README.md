# Software.com.br Homepage Conversion

This project is a static HTML conversion of the WordPress homepage [software.com.br](https://software.com.br/)  
It was built using **TailwindCSS**, **Swiper.js**, and **Alpine.js**.

## Project Structure

- `dist/output.css` → Compiled Tailwind CSS file.
- `Images/` → All static images and assets.
- `input.css` → Kept for future style modifications or rebuilds if needed.

## Features
- Fully responsive layout (mobile-first)
- Swiper-based testimonials and client logo sliders
- Clean and maintainable TailwindCSS structure

## How to Run
Just open `Src/index.html` in your browser.

## Developer Note
